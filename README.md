📌 AI Camera Motion Tracking System
🚀 Real-time person detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time person detection using YOLOv8
✅ Multi-person tracking with DeepSORT
✅ Optimized performance using NumPy and Kalman Filters
✅ Works with webcams and video files

 How It Works?
YOLOv8 detects people in each video frame.
DeepSORT assigns a unique ID to each person and tracks their movement.
Kalman Filtering improves tracking accuracy.
Bounding boxes and labels are displayed on the screen.
